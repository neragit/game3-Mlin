Nine men's morris game single player recreated as a personal project

The game is played on a 24-point grid. Each player starts with 9 pieces. Players aim to form 'mills'—three pieces in a row—which allows them to select and remove 1 opponent's piece. A player wins by reducing the opponent to two pieces or leaving them with no legal moves. 

The game has three phases. First, players take turns placing pieces on any empty point. Ater placing all 9 pieces on the board, players are only allowed to move to adjacent empty points. When a player is left with three pieces, they can move pieces to any vacant point.
